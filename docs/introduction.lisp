;;;# Introduction
;;;
;;; ParenScript is a simple language that looks a lot like Lisp, but
;;; actually is JavaScript in disguise. Actually, it is JavaScript
;;; embedded in a host Lisp. This way, JavaScript programs can be
;;; seamlessly integrated in a Lisp web application. The programmer
;;; doesn't have to resort to a different syntax, and JavaScript code
;;; can easily be generated without having to resort to complicated
;;; string generation or `FORMAT' expressions.
;;;
;;; An example is worth more than a thousand words. The following Lisp
;;; expression is a call to the ParenScript "compiler". The
;;; ParenScript "compiler" transforms the expression in ParenScript
;;; into an equivalent, human-readable expression in JavaScript.

(ps
  (defun foobar (a b)
    (return (+ a b))))

;;; The resulting javascript is:
"
function foobar(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}
"
;;; Great care has been given to the indentation and overall
;;; readability of the generated JavaScript code.

;;;# Features
;;;
;;; ParenScript supports all the statements and expressions defined by
;;; the EcmaScript 262 standard. Lisp symbols are converted to
;;; camelcase, javascript-compliant syntax. This idea is taken from
;;; Linj by Antonio Menezes Leitao.  Here are a few examples of Lisp
;;; symbol to JavaScript name conversion:

(js-to-string 'foobar)      => "foobar"
(js-to-string 'foo-bar)     => "fooBar"
(js-to-string 'foo-b-@-r)   => "fooBAtR"
(js-to-string 'foo-b@r)     => "fooBatr"
(js-to-string '*array)      => "Array"
(js-to-string '*math.floor) => "Math.floor"

;;; It also supports additional iteration constructs, relieving the
;;; programmer of the burden of iterating over arrays.
;;; `for' loops can be written using the customary `DO*' syntax.

(ps
  (do* ((i 0 (incf i))
        (j (aref arr i) (aref arr i)))
       ((>= i 10))
    (alert (+ "i is " i " and j is " j))))

;; compiles to
"
for (var i = 0, j = arr[i]; i < 10; i = ++i, j = arr[i]) {
  alert('i is ' + i + ' and j is ' + j);
};
"
;;; ParenScript uses the Lisp reader, allowing for reader macros. It
;;; also comes with its own macro environment, allowing host Lisp
;;; macros and ParenScript macros to coexist without interfering with
;;; each other.  For example, the `1+' construct is implemented using
;;; a ParenScript macro:

(defpsmacro 1+ (form)
  `(+ ,form 1))

;;; ParenScript allows the creation of JavaScript objects in a Lispy
;;; way, using keyword arguments.

(ps
  (create :foo "foo"
          :bla "bla"))

;; compiles to
"
{ foo : 'foo',
  bla : 'bla' }
"
;;; ParenScript features a HTML generator. Using the same syntax as
;;; the HTMLGEN package of Franz, Inc., it can generate JavaScript
;;; string expressions. This allows for a clean integration of HTML in
;;; ParenScript code, instead of writing the tedious and error-prone
;;; string generation code generally found in JavaScript.

(ps
  (defun add-div (name href link-text)
    (document.write
     (ps-html ((:div :id name)
               "The link is: "
               ((:a :href href) link-text))))))

;; compiles to
"
function addDiv(name, href, linkText) {
  document.write('<div id=\"' + name + '\">The link is: <a href=\"'
                                + href + '\">'
                                + linkText + '</a></div>');
}
"
;;; In order to have a complete web application framework available in
;;; Lisp, ParenScript also provides a sexp-based syntax for CSS
;;; stylesheets. Thus, a complete web application featuring HTML, CSS
;;; and JavaScript documents can be generated using Lisp syntax,
;;; allowing the programmer to use Lisp macros to factor out the
;;; redundancies and complexities of Web syntax. For example, to
;;; generate a CSS inline node in a HTML document using the
;;; AllegroServe HTMLGEN library:

(html-stream *standard-output*
  (html
   (:html
    (:head
     (css (* :border "1px solid black")
          (div.bl0rg :font-family "serif")
          (("a:active" "a:hoover") :color "black" :size "200%"))))))

;; which produces

<html><head><style type="text/css">
<!--
* {
   border:1px solid black;
}

div.bl0rg {
   font-family:serif;
}

a:active,a:hoover {
   color:black;
   size:200%;
}

-->
</style>
</head>
</html>
